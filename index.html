    <p>Well, since the name felt pretty self-explanatory I just thought we would learn how ti make websites and design them. I decided it was for me because I already knew some of the basics and I was taking another class on it. It would help me ingraine the information into my head and possibly make it better too. Also, not gonna lie, my friends also signed up for this, a few also taking the same other class as me, so in combination it was really a no brainer for me to choose this class.</p>
