        <p>My skills in web design and developments have improved a lot since I joined the class. In the beginning I had to look up a lot of things to know what to do, but now I can do nigh everything from the top of my head. Besides that, I learned quite a few things from this class. An important one, especially for this subject is how to use Github. From pushing, pulling, branching, and how to work with multiple people on github were all learned in this class. I also learned how to look for jobs I am interested in and their differing salaries throughout the country. I also learned how to make a resume and cover letter  in this beginning of the year.</p>
